# Axiom for Everyone

> Axiom Player Assistance Mod: The forge-compatible player assistance utility mod ideal for anarchy servers

Axiom for Everyone™ is a project aimed at providing Axiom Player Assistance Mod to everyone free of charge. We believe in free proprietary
software and Open Source Software (OSS) license compliance. At Axiom for Everyone™, we have dedicated time to reverse engineering Axiom
Player Assistance Mod and its obfuscation methods to accomplish our goals.

## Notice

We are not the maintainers of Axiom, we only provide modified jars for the public that free the constraints in place by the original jars.
